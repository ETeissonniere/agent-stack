# YouTube Curator Policies

Welcome to the policy hub for the YouTube Curator project. This agent analyzes your YouTube subscriptions, scores videos with AI, and emails you a daily digest. To keep everything transparent for Google OAuth verification (and for you!), we publish a concise privacy policy and terms of service here.

- [Terms of Service](terms-of-service.md)
