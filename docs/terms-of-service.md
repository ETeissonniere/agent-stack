# Terms of Service

Effective Date: 2025-09-17

These Terms govern your use of the YouTube Curator application ("the Service"). By running the Service you agree to these Terms and the Privacy Policy.

## 1. Description
The Service fetches videos from your YouTube subscriptions, analyzes them with Gemini 2.5 Flash, and emails you a curated digest via your SMTP account. It operates locally or in your own hosting environment using credentials you provide.

## 2. Eligibility & Accounts
The Service is designed for personal use. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of OAuth tokens, SMTP credentials, and configuration files stored on your systems.

## 3. Acceptable Use
- Access only YouTube channels and data you are authorized to use.
- Configure schedules and quotas responsibly to comply with YouTube and Google API policies.
- Do not modify the Service to bypass rate limits, privacy protections, or platform restrictions.

## 4. Content Ownership
You retain rights to your YouTube data and generated email digests. YouTube content remains governed by Google’s terms. AI annotations are provided for convenience only.

## 5. AI Output
AI-generated annotations are heuristics and may contain errors. Verify important conclusions independently. The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of accuracy.

## 6. Email Delivery
You are solely responsible for the SMTP credentials you configure and for complying with your email provider’s policies, including anti-spam requirements.

## 7. Updates & Availability
The developer may update, modify, or discontinue the Service at any time without prior notice. Continued use after updates signifies acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 8. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service is provided "as is" without implied warranties. Liability is limited to the amount you paid for the software (typically zero). The developer is not responsible for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

## 9. Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developer from claims, damages, or expenses arising from misuse of the Service, unauthorized access to data, or violations of these Terms or applicable policies.

## 10. Termination
You may stop using the Service at any time. Deleting configuration files and tokens removes stored data. The developer may terminate support or access at their discretion.

## 11. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of your jurisdiction of residence unless otherwise required.
